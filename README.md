# fibonacci_series

Hello Coders,

This repository is mainly targeted to collect program's in various programming languages of the famous Fibonacci series.

## What is fibonacci series

A series of numbers in which each number (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding numbers is called as the Fibonacci Series.

The Fibonacci numbers can easily obtained by using the following formula:

      Tn = Tn-1 + Tn-2 
where  
   - Tn = current term.
   - Tn-1 = preceeding term.
   - Tn-2 = second preceeding term.

This gives us the following sequence that goes to infinity:

        1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....
